We find that \ourisa{}'s ProtL1 is
critical to \ourdefense{}'s performance, and tracking memory
protection beyond the L1D has diminished benefit.
When disabled, \ourdefense{}-Track-ARCH/CT's overhead increases from
12.0\%/46.3\% to 32.2\%/57.0\% on the SPEC2017 Integer
benchmarks running on a P-core. When the ProtL1 is re-
placed with a shadow memory that perfectly tracks protection,
PROTEAN-Track-ARCH/CT’s drops to 4.5\%/39.5\%, primarily
benefiting non-secret-accessing, but not constant-time, code.
